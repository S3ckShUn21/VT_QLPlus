- The shield can only be placed on the arduino in one orientation
- For the purpose of this document the LED is on the TOP side of the shield compared to the external pins

Linear Actuator
===============
	- The linear actuator should be plugged in on the LED side of the shield
	- If the shield gets dammaged/lost, the signal pin should be plugged into pin 3 of the arduino
		(reference the code for the most up to date pin numbering)
	- The pin mapping is as follows
		
            () LED             |
	       (==) Resistor   |
			       |  'Right'		
		-* SIG (White) |
		-* +5V (Red)   |
		-* GND (Black) |
	  ----------------------
		'Bottom'

MyoWare Sensor
==============
	- The MyoWare sensor should be plugged in on the opposite side of the LED
	- If the shield gets dammaged/lost, the signal pin should be plugged into pin A0 of the arduino
		(reference the code for the most up to date pin numbering)
	- The pin mapping is as follows

		|   -* SIG (White)
		|   -* GND (Black)
       'Left'	|   -* +5V (Red)
		|
		|
		-----------------------
			'Bottom'
LED
==============
	- If the shield gets dammaged/lost, the LED should be plugged into pin 7 of the arduino
		(reference the code for the most up to date pin numbering)
